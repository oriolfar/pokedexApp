# üìö Pokedex Project

This is a mobile application developed using React Native CLI that serves as a Pokedex. The app retrieves Pokemon data from the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/) using an API integration. It features lazy loading infinite scroll for the Pokemon list, a detailed Pokemon page with specifications, and a search bar to filter Pokemon by name. The entire project is built using TypeScript.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Lazy Loading Infinite Scroll:** The Pokemon list is loaded in a lazy manner, allowing for smooth scrolling and improved performance. As the user scrolls down, additional Pokemon are loaded automatically.
- **Pokemon Details Page:** Clicking on a specific Pokemon in the list opens a dedicated page displaying detailed information about the selected Pokemon, including its specifications, abilities, and other relevant details.
- **Search Bar:** The app includes a search bar that enables users to filter Pokemon by name. As the user types in the search query, the list dynamically updates to display matching Pokemon.
